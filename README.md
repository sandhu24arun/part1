# This is my landing page - https://web.njit.edu/~ass99/ - for the password I made sure the password was being shown when typed, also if "@" is not typed the form will not be able to be submitted 
# Question page - https://web.njit.edu/~ass99/questions - I added a text area for the question body and skills with the words "multiple skills seperate by commas"
# Registration page - https://web.njit.edu/~ass99/registration - added calendar for the birthday and added the other fields - once again the "@" has to be typed in otherwise you cannot submit.
